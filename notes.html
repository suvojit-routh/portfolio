            <h1>Designing a portfolio? That’s one thing. Committing to a single concept? That’s the real challenge.</h1>
            <p>I first set out to create this portfolio a few years ago. Between projects, I kept coming back to it,
                sometimes refreshing a design or rethinking an approach, all the while sharpening my skills with new
                technologies and ideas. Like many developers, the concept of a portfolio is always evolving — and a lot
                of that is influenced by the changes in tech trends (remember when flat design was all the rage, then
                everything went responsive?).</p>
            <p>Why so many iterations? Part of me couldn’t commit to a single direction. I wanted each element to feel
                genuinely me, and that meant a lot of revisiting. In a way, this portfolio became a side project — a
                place to test out new ideas and refine my design language.</p>
            <p>Now that it’s finally coming together, I’m excited but also slightly nostalgic about the whole process.
                The sketching, prototyping, designing, and coding are largely finished, but I’ll always be adding new
                touches as I learn. I’m looking forward to incorporating a few fun animations in the near future to make
                it pop even more.</p>
            <p>Over the coming weeks, I’ll also be documenting the decisions I made throughout the process — from
                inspiration to development, and how I adapted my ideas along the way. Hopefully, this can give anyone
                building their own portfolio some insights (and maybe even a shortcut or two)!</p>
